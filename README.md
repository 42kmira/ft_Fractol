This is another project in the graphics branch. It has us making fractals using a basic graphics library called minilibx. The fractals are
made by having direct access to a pixel array that is displayed on the window. Due to the independent rendering of each pixel I am able to use
multithreading to calculate the pixels RBG values in parallel.

Mandelbrot set, Julia set and Burning Ship fractals!

All the fractals zoom, and respond to mouse movements so use cautiously. Instructions should be found when the program runs.

Can you find the explosion of sea life and manta rays in burning ship?

Note: I did not code minilibx. It was provided to us by our school. All the other work however was coded by me.
